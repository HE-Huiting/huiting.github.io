            <h3><i><ins>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</ins></i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience was the change in the screen, which originally looked like the first floor of an abandoned building. If I take the picture as the first view, I have a piece of metal in front of me like a piece of tin foil texture. As I moved the mouse, the image began to distort and fluctuate like a liquid, with ripples and an intense, blinding light.

                <i><ins>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</ins></i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Randomly slide the mouse to observe the changes in the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try different trajectories of movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try to accelerate, decelerate or randomly shift the speed of the sliding mouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adjust the settings of each column separately and slide the mouse to compare the differences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adjust multiple settings and observe the differences.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Adjust multiple settings and observe the differences. If the question is about the column in the settings that takes the most time, then it's the "gleams" column.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Slide the mouse.
                </p>

                <i><ins>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</ins></i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The intended primary goal of the interactive experience was to provide a quirky, futuristic fantasy experience?
                </p>
                <br>

                <i>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</ins></i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal is that of a fun interactive installation, but it also leaves me confused.
                </p>
                <br>

                <i><ins>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</ins></i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I experienced this process for over ten minutes and I was amazed at how the screen actually changed with the slide of the mouse. I was curious about how this was made. But after I explored all the settings I became confused. The interactive device was cool, but I couldn't be sure what the author was trying to say. I couldn't find any text description either.
                </p>
                <br>

                <i><ins>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</ins></i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The site offers multiple adjustment buttons for the user to experience, which is probably a way of communicating that the user still has something to explore over time.
                </p>
                <br>

                <i><ins>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Probably video, sound, animation, and modeling.
                </p>
                <br>

                <i><ins>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Focus on the experience and appreciate the dynamic changes in the picture and the sound that goes with it.
                </p>
                <br>

                <i><ins>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Excited and surprised. I think the interaction setup is very creative and interesting.
                </p>
                <br>

                <i><ins>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The most frustrating factor for me is that I can't seem to understand the author's ideas very well because there are no written instructions.
                </p>
                <br>

                <i><ins>13) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</i>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The most satisfying factor is this picture, this "material", metallic liquid, look really cool. This is because of the author's creativity and production techniques, the picture looks so realistic.
